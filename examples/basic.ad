Variable are where you store stuff:

[source, swift]
--
var a = 1.23
var b = 4.56
a*b
--

Loops are used to do repetious work --
bad for humans, but computers love it:-)

[source, swift]
--
var sum = 0.0
for k in 1...100 { sum += 1.0/Double(k)}
sum
--

What happens to the sum as n gets larger and larger?
