INTRODUCTION

ad2play is Ruby script which converts
files written in asciidoc markup 
to Swift playgrounds. To use ad2play,
type

$ ./ad2pl foo.ad

or 

$ ruby ad2pl foo.ad

This will produce a Swift playground 
named foo.playgound

INSTALLATION

installed.  Install asciidoctor if 
necessary. See http://asciidoctor.org[asiidoctor].

COMMENTS

ad2pl used http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] to 
convert the markup into the bundle of files
that make up a Swift playground.

The advantage of writing in asciidoc is that 
the same file can be used to publish in
different "media". If you have content
you wish to publish that resides in "foo.ad"
run the command *asciidoctor foo.ad*
to produce _foo.html_.  Run
the command  *ad2play foo.ad*
to produce the Swift playground bundle
_foo.playground_.  

See http://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor.org]
for information on how to use and install
asciidoctor. I would like to credit jas
whose http://github.com/jas/swift-playground-builder[playground-builder]
inspired me to write *ad2play*.  

Current version of *ad2play*: 0.1 (hacked together).
